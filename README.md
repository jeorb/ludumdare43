# [Ludum Dare 43 Entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/jeorbs-folly)

Game written in Rust with the [Amethyst game engine](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/)
for [Ludum Dare 43](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/).

Move the player with the arrow keys.  Deflect each mob before it escapes the screen
to score a point.  Lose a point if a mob escapes without being deflected.

Press Q to quit.

This game was written by following along with the
[Amethyst Book's](https://www.amethyst.rs/book/latest/) Pong tutorial and creating the game by modifying that base.

I submitted this to the Jam rather than the compo for two reasons:
1. I'm not sure if basing the game code on a tutorial counts as "from scratch".
2. I couldn't think of a name for the game and used a suggestion from a friend.

Enjoy!

(Or more likely not :-P)
