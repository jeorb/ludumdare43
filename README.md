# Ludum Dare 43 Compo Entry

Game written in Rust with the [Amethyst game engine](https://jeorb.github.io/icfp2006/web/)
for the Ludum Dare 43 compo.

Move the player with the arrow keys.  Deflect each mob before it escapes the screen
to score a point.  Lose a point if a mob escapes without being deflected.

Press Q to quit.

This game was written for the compo by following along with the
[Amethyst Book's](https://www.amethyst.rs/book/latest/) Pong tutorial and creating the game by modifying that base.

I submitted this to the Jam rather than the compo for two reasons:
1. I'm not sure if basing the game code on a tutorial counts as "from scratch".
2. I couldn't think of a name for the game and used a suggestion from a friend.

Enjoy!

(Or more likely not :-P)
